## Features

This module provides macros to automatically add or remove weaknesses and resistances to NPC tokens in Foundry VTT, making combat more dynamic and challenging. The values are automatically calculated based on the NPC's level, ensuring a smooth integration with game progression.

### üõ†Ô∏è Main Features/Macros:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Random Weaknesses & Resistances:</strong> The main macro applies a random weakness and resistance to every NPC token in the current scene that doesn‚Äôt already have one. The values range from 1 to 5, depending on the NPC's level, ensuring the balance of power across different levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Random Weaknesses & Resistances*2:</strong> Similar to the the main macro, this one goes from 2 to 10 instead, depending on lv for a bigger effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Specific Weakness & Resistance:</strong> A macro that allows the GM to select specific damage types and values for weakness and resistance on the selected tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove Weakness & Resistance:</strong> Easily remove any applied weakness or resistance from all NPC tokens in the scene using a single macro.</li>
</ul>
